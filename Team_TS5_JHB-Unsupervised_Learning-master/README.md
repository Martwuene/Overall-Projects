# Movie recommendation system using unsupervised machine learning.

Recommendation algorithms are at the core of many service providers strategies. They provide consumers
with personalized suggestions to reduce time spent looking for an item or a service. This inturn reduce
the frustration of finding great content to watch on **Netflix**, awesome books on **Amazon**, terrific  videos
on **Youtube** and incredible other recommendations from other service providers.
The importance of a recommender system cannot be stressed enough. The financial benefits are enomous which is why big companies/organizations employ them.


In this repository, we build a movie recommendation system. A typical scenario of where you will need our system
is that of a **Friday** night, while having a nice cup of wine, some snacks sitting comfortably in your lounge,
or bed, all alone, or with some company. An almost perfect night, except that you don't have thee perfect movie.
Now you wish you had went out, but you can't since there is still **Covid-19** and you are **locked-down**. You turn to
our movie recommender and you recall you enjoyed a movie called **The heart of Christmas** and then booom:

1. Content based filtering
2. Colaborative filtering
