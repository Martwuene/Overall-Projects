## Stock Fundamental Analysis

The goal of this project is to compare two combined screeners for both Greenblatt's Magic Formula and Piotroski F-Score to see the performance and comparison to value stocks that trade on Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

### 1. Magic Formula investing

Investor Joel Greenblatt initially introduced the magic formula technique in his best-selling 2005 book, The Little Book That Beats the Market, and its 2010 sequel, The Little Book That Still Beats the Market. Greenblatt, the company's founder and former fund manager, is a Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumnus. He serves as an adjunct lecturer at the business school of Columbia University.

Greenblatt lists two parameters for choosing stocks to buy in the book: stock price and firm cost of capital. Investors choose the 20 to 30 top-ranked firms to invest in by using Greenblatt's online stock screener tool rather than performing basic analyses of businesses and equities.

### 2. F-Score scoring

The Piotroski score, which ranges from 0 to 9, represents nine factors that are used to gauge the health of a firm's financial status.
The best value stocks are identified using the Piotroski score, where nine represents the highest value and zero represents the worst.

Joseph Piotroski, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago, created the scale and gave it the Piotroski score, which is based on certain elements of financial statements from businesses. The current accounting results of the corporation are the main emphasis (years). One point is given for each requirement that is satisfied (listed below); otherwise, no points are given. The top value stocks are then identified by adding the points.
